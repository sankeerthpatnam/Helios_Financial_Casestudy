Helios – Hypothetical Case Study
Helios is a hypothetical company used for a financial and strategic case study. It does not exist in reality. This project is designed to showcase financial modeling, scenario analysis, and strategic decision making skills in a heavy R&D technology enverionment. 

About Helios

Helios is a pre-product hydrogen startup focused on solving a major challenge in liquid hydrogen (LH2) technology: efficient production, near zero loss storage, and precise fueling. The company’s technology is aimed at military, NASA, and Space Force applications, including vehicles, rockets, planes, and large land mobility platforms.

Core products and technology include:

1. LH2 production systems that convert water to hydrogen and then to liquid hydrogen, with potential improvements to increase efficiency and reduce energy loss

2. Large-scale LH2 storage systems for fuel generators

3. Miniaturized LH2 storage for vehicles

4. LH2 fueling and transfer systems, including pipes and fueling stations.
5. An interface managing all of these hydrogen interactions. 

Pain Point Being Solved: The main challenge is that current LH2 storage experiences significant boil-off, which results in fuel loss over time. Helios aims to develop highly efficient storage and transfer systems with minimal loss, while also improving the LH2 generation process itself to make production more efficient and reliable. These improvements are critical for advanced propulsion applications.

Business Model and Strategy

Revenue comes primarily from military and space agency contracts and R&D grants. The company has heavy initial investment in research and development and manufacturing. The strategic focus includes:

Solving the fundamental LH2 efficiency problem in production, storage, and fueling

Scaling manufacturing of storage tanks and miniaturized systems

Exploring long-term applications for propulsion across air, water, land, and space
