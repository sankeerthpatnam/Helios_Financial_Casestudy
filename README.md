Helios Case Study for Hydrogen Storage and Fueling

Welcome to the Helios Case Study. This project explores a hypothetical hydrogen startup focused on solving a major challenge in hydrogen adoption. The company works on storing and fueling liquid hydrogen with almost no loss.

Helios develops advanced cryogenic tanks and fueling systems. The team uses an AI simulation engine to understand how hydrogen behaves under pressure and extreme temperatures. This case study shows strategic thinking, financial modeling, and scenario analysis for a pre-product hydrogen technology company.

Highlights

The scenario switch lets you see how different outcomes affect revenue, margins, and net income.

Early years focus on building the AI simulation and prototyping tanks and fueling systems.

The strategy is to focus on tanks first and then move to vehicle integration. The company targets DoD, NASA, and early industrial adopters.

Technology assumptions are ambitious. LH2 boil-off is under 0.2 percent daily and designs are optimized for efficiency and scalability.

How to Use
